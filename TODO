* First, look for the string "ToDo" in the source, and fix those!

* Then look at

     - We need better / more documentation in the http/key.h filem in
       doxygen format.
     - Support the lookup / store functions for parsed Key object cache
     - Support "" around string values (for the tokenizer)
     - Finish all the parsers
     - Finish all the evaluators
     - The error cases are not handled well likely, we need to figure that out
